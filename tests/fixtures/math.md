Pythagoras theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ where a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is the hypotenuse.

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ for the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$ states that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.

The Pythagorean identity:

$$\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$$

Euler's identity, often considered the most beautiful equation in mathematics:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

The normal distribution probability density function:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$
